ðŸš€ Exploring Data Insights with Power BI

Project Overview
This project is a hands-on Power BI dashboard built using the Sample Superstore dataset. The goal was to analyze sales, profit, and product performance to extract actionable business insights. The dashboard allows interactive exploration of key metrics and trends to support data-driven decisions.

 Key Insights
- Customers drive most of the profits: Consumer buyers contribute almost half of the total profit (46.8%), showing that regular customers are the strongest profit generators.  
- Technology leads the way: Among all categories, Technology products bring the highest profit ($145K), followed by Office Supplies and Furniture.  
- West region is the top performer: The West region generated the highest profit ($108K), indicating strong demand or efficient operations.  
- Sales vs. Profit isnâ€™t always proportional: High sales donâ€™t always translate to high profits. Furniture and Office Supplies show significant sales but comparatively lower profit.  
- Sub-category winners and losers: Phones and Storage appliances perform best in sales and profit, whereas Tables and Bookcases have good sales but minimal profit, highlighting margin challenges.
